To do so, you must first successfully break into the level 1-4 safes. The more safes you break into, the harder it is to break into, well, more safes.<br><br>
            <div class = "how-to-win">How to break into a safe:</div><br>To break into a safe, you must correctly guess 3 numbers that add up and multiply to 2 random numbers. Here is an example: "The two random numbers are 5 and 4. Find 3 numbers that add up to 5 and multiply to 4." The random numbers get progressively larger as you reach higher levels.<br><br>
            <div class = "restart">Restart The Game:</div><br>To restart the game, simply press the "Restart" button. You will only be able to press it once you have successfully beat the last round (level 5), or if you entered incorrect values. Otherwise, what's the point of restarting if you are on a winning streak?!
